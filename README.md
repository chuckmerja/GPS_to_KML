# GPS_to_KML
Found this cool project and want to grab it and build off of it.
ESP32 and GPS and SD card writes GPS locations to SD card in KML format, should be able to open in Google Earth.  Some buttons and lights for control of recording and feedback.  Nice tut here... https://www.tastethecode.com/trail-mapping-with-gps-esp32-and-microsd-card
